# Scaling: x* refers to the unscaled perturbation variable
# q = q*/1
# T_0 = T_0*/10
# T = T*/10

# this is the only tf which changes due to scaling => equates to *0.1

# Performance:
# The plant will perform well to input (R) and disturbance tracking as it
# is self regulating i.e. |Gd| < 1 for all frequencies.
#
# Controllability:
# It is self regulating so... this is awkward...
