"""This file is intended to be the target of a pytest run.

It will find all .ipynb files in the current directory, ignoring directories
which start with . and any files which match patterins found in the file
.testignore

Example .testignore pattern to ignore files in a directory:

    under_construction/*

Sample invocations of pytest which make the output nicely readable:

    pytest --verbose --durations=5 test.py

If you install pytest-xdist you can run tests in parallel with

    pytest --verbose --durations=5 -n 4 test.py
