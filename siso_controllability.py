This module checks if your plant conforms to the SISO controllability rules
as explained in Skogestad chapter 5.14.
"""

import control as cn
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import control_add_on as cadd

"""
Rule 1 and 2: |e| < 1 for acceptable control given feedback

Rule 1: Speed of response to reject disturbances.
How fast must the plant be to be able to reject disturbances?
e = S*Gd*d
If you require |e| < 1 and given the worst case disturbance i.e. |d| = 1
then |S*Gd| < 1 (assuming feedback control is used). 

Rule 2: Speed of response to track reference changes.
Similar to rule 1 but this time you want |S| < 1\R where
R is the max allowed reference change relative to the allowed error.

Rules 5 - 8:
These are more like bounds on the bandwidth given certain characteristics of the
system.
They do depend on the bound of either S or T... (S for zeros, T for poles via internal stability)
The important thing is really just Theorem 5.3 + the interpolation constraints... everything else
follows from that.
