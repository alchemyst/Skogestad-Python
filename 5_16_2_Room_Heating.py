From Disturbance Bode you can see |G| > |Gd| always. This implies that
there will not be any input constraints wrt disturbances. (Rule 3)
I.e. your system will always be strong enough to counteract your disturbances.

Using R = 3 you get an intersection of w_r = 0.0065 which implies that 
the plant will be able to track set point changes up to w_r. The required response time
is 1/1000 = 0.001. Therefore w_r is better than the required response time.

From Feedback Constraint Bode you can see that the feedback loop of the
system will be able to handle any disturbance input.

However, at about w = 0.004 rad/s you can see that setpoints will not be tracked
that is, the error will be more than one.

From the output you can see that because the upper bound of w_c is so close to the lower bound of
